## Introduction
fastSparseGAMs is a Python package that offers an efficient framework for solving L0-regularized learning problems in sparse generalized additive models (GAMs). Leveraging the [L0Learn](https://github.com/TNonet/L0Learn) package, this package introduces two novel algorithms, namely quadratic cuts and dynamic feature ordering, to deliver faster computational speed. Additionally, it comes with a new loss function (exponential loss) for classification.

## Package Installation

The latest version can be installed from pip as follows:
```bash
pip install fastsparsegams
```

## Documentation
An example on how to use `fastSparseGAMs` is provided at this [tutorial page](https://github.com/tynanseltzer/L0Learn/blob/master/python/tutorial_example/example.py).

fastSparseGAMs is developed upon the framework of L0Learn, featuring faster and novel algorithms implemented internally.
We do not alter the external Python interface functions.
Therefore, please see L0Learn's python documentation available [here](https://tnonet.github.io/L0Learn/tutorial.html) for the detailed API documentation.
The external function usage is almost idential to L0Learn's API except replacing the module name `l0learn` with `fastsparsegams`.

# Source Code and Installing from Source
Alternatively, `fastSparseGAMs` can be build from source
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tynanseltzer/L0Learn.git
cd python
```

To install, ensure the proper packages are installed from `pyproject.toml` build from source with the following:
```bash
pip install ".[test]"
```

To test, run the following command:
```bash
python -m pytest
```
